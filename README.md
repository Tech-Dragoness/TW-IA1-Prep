# Differentiating Shapes: A beginner's guide

There are many different shapes that we commonly come across in everyday life. Here, let's have a look at 5 commonly found shapes, how to identify them and differentiate them from other similar shapes.

Shapes covered:

1. Square
2. Circle
3. Triangle
4. Rectangle
5. Rhombus

Let's get started!!!

## 1. Square

  ![Square](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f518b164-5b1c-4848-bae5-ac89c22676af)

This shape has 4 sides. Let's call each side as s1, s2, s3 and s4 respectively. All four of them are of an equal length. Each side touches it's neighbouring side on it's edge. For example, consider s1 from the diagram. It has edges e1 and e4. The edge e1 is shared with the neighbouring side s4. The edges of the sides join at right angles and opposite sides are parallel to each other.

## 2. Circle

Imagine if you tried to draw a line such that, every point on the line is having the same distance from one particular dot. Let's call this dot o. It is the center of this shape. You will notice that the drawn line e, will be continuously curving to maintain the same distance r from the center o and eventually, the line reaches where it had started. This shape thus has no edges.

## 3. Triangle

![Triangle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a8a2025-9cea-4a46-b844-93270d321ab2)

This shape has 3 sides s1, s2 and s3 along with 3 edges e1, e2 and e3 that form when the sides touch their edges to one another as shown in the diagram. The length of the sides and the angle made by two sides having the same edges can vary.

## 4. Rectangle

![Rectangle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5c229c3-ee53-461c-815f-143bea7226aa)

Looking familiar? This shape is very similar to a square, the difference is the unlike a square where all sides are equal in length, a rectangle's sides have opposite sides with equal length (s1=s3 and s4=s2) but adjacent sides are not. (s1 ≠ s2, s1 ≠ s4).

---

## 5. Rhombus

![Rhombus](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4045238-2931-4547-a383-40dd63478711)

Again, this shape is similar to a square, with all four sides of equal length. But a square must have the angle at all of it's edges as 90° whereas here it can vary, but opposite edges will have equal degrees. Basically, it looks like a lopsided square.
